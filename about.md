I am a student from School of Information,Renmin University of China. I am familiar with data mining and modeling by using Python,R and Matlab ,I also have strong analytical, creative problem solving and research skills as well as solid mathematics, probability and statistics foundation. I like to explore values and insights behind data, and love to implement some interesting ideas by coding. Meanwhile,I have a strong interest in philosophy and aesthetic.

### Education
- Jinhua No.1 High School，Zhejiang [2009-2012]
- Shanghai University / Mathematics and Applied Mathematics [2012-2016]
- Renmin University of China / Software Engineering [2016-2018]

### Experience

- NetEase

	Data Mining and Machine Learning[2017]


- Didi Chuxing

	Spatio-temporal Data Mining , Time Series Modeling and Visualization[2017]


- Capgemini

	During this Internship , I followed up to two Nike Digital Projects and I was in charge of Data Analysis in those projects [2016]


- Dentsu Aegis Network

	In charge of integrating data in several media data platforms [2015]</p>


### Project

- Community Antispam Task (TianChi)
	
	We use unsupervised learning to solve this problem and develop an unique way to extract evolutionary feature,finally we got 2th in this competition.


- Passenger Flow Prediction (TianChi)
	
	In this data comeptition , I used mean-method and time series model to predict the passenger flow in airport . Finally , I got 32th in this competition (total 3038 teams).

- Link Prediction (Kaggle) 
	
	In this task , I used text mining , complex network , traditional machine learning algorithm and neural network model to predict the citation relation between papers. [Data Science Winter School Class Project  | Tsinghua, Renmin and Ecole Polytechnique] 


### Paper

- A Neural Collaborative Filtering Model with Interaction-based Neighborhood(CIKM’17 , November 6–10, 2017, Singapore)

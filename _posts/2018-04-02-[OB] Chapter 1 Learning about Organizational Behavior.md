### Concepts

`Organizational behavior`

Organizational behavior is the study of individuals and groups within an organizational context, and the study of internal processes and practices as they influence the effectiveness of individuals, teams, and organizations

`Leadership`

Leadership is the process of developing ideas and a **vision**, living by values that support those ideas and that vision, influencing others to embrace them in their own behaviors, and making hard decisions about human and other resources.

`manager`

Likewise, in contrast to being a leader, a manager directs, **controls**, and plans the work of others and is responsible for results

`ethics competency`

The ethics competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities to incorporate values and principles that distinguish right from wrong when making **decisions** and choosing behav- iors. Ethics are the values and principles that distinguish right from wrong.

`ethical dilemma`

An ethical dilemma occurs when a decision must be made that involves multiple values. An ethical dilemma doesn’t always involve choosing right over wrong because there may be several **competing** values.

`self competency`

The self competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities to assess personal strengths and weaknesses, set and pursue professional and **personal** goals, balance work and personal life, and engage in new learning.

`diversity competency`

The diversity competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities to value unique individual, group, and organizational characteristics, embrace such characteristics as potential sources of strength, and appreciate the uniqueness of each.This competency includes the ability to help people work effectively together even if their interests and backgrounds are **different**.

`Global mind-set`

Global mind-set—viewing the environment from a **worldwide perspective**, always looking for unexpected trends that may create threats or opportunities for a unit or an entire organization.

The communication competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities to use all the modes of transmitting, understanding, and receiving ideas, thoughts, and feelings—verbal, listening, nonverbal, and written—for accurately transferring and **exchanging information**

`describing skill`

describing skill—identifying **concrete**, **specific** examples of behavior and its effects

`active listening`

active listening—the process of **integrating** information and emotions in a search for shared meaning and understanding

`questioning skill`

questioning skill—the ability to **ask** for information and opinions in a way that gets relevant, honest, and appropriate responses

nonverbal communication—facial expressions, body movements, physical contact, and symbols that are often used to send messages

`empathizing skill`

empathizing skill refers to detecting and understanding another person’s values, motives, and emotions

`verbal communication`

verbal communication effectively—presenting ideas, information and emotions to others, either one to one, between teams, or between organizations

`written communication`

written communication effectively—the ability to transfer data, information, ideas, and emotions by means of reports, letters, memos, notes, and e-mail

`teams competency`

The teams competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities to develop, support, and lead groups to achieve goals.

### Notes 

2. people have the ability to constantly take risks and seek ways to both improve and grow.
3. The long-term effectiveness of an organization is determined by its ability to anticipate, manage, and respond to changes in its environment.
4. Leadership is accomplishing something through other people that wouldn’t have happened if you weren’t there
5. Leadership can be learned but not taught. Learning leadership means that you are actively seeking to develop the com- petencies and make the personal changes required to become a leader
6. An effective employee understands what affects her or his own behavior before attempting to influence the behaviors of others
7. Both internal and external factors shape a person’s behavior on the job. Among others, internal factors include learning ability, motiva- tion, perception, attitudes, personality, and values. Among the external factors that affect a person’s behavior are the organization’s reward system, groups and teams, managerial leadership styles, organizational culture, and the organization’s design
8. In general, the greater a person’s level of responsibilities and authority, the more the person is likely to face increasingly complex and ambiguous ethical issues and dilemmas
9. A career encompasses not only traditional work experiences but also the opportunity for career alternatives, individual choices, and individual experiences
10. The shape and direction of a person’s career over time are influenced by many factors (e.g., the economy, availability of jobs, skill acquisition, personal characteristics, family status, and job history)
10. Learning from individuals, teams, or organizations with  different characteristics, experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds. Diversity of thought and behavior is vital to stimulating creativity and innovation
11. It is essential for leaders to develop a deeper understanding of the country and the culture in which they operate and try to learn about its strengths
12. When you have a very diverse team—people of different backgrounds, different culture, different gender, different age, you are going to get a more creative team—probably getting better solutions, and enforcing them in a very innovative way and with a very limited number of preconceived ideas
13. To lead effectively and achieve real business results as the head of any enterprise, you have to listen. You’ve got to constantly ask questions and seek out diverse opinions, and remain humble enough to change your mind—whether about a product or a person.
14. Listening has its drawback because sometimes you realize that people are just telling you what they want you to hear.
15. Two cultural values that strongly affect deci- sions about whether to use teams and groups in organizations are individualism and collectivism
16. The potential for teams and individuals to have incompatible goals clearly exists, but these goals need not always be in conflict. In fact, they often are compatible
17. New technologies are increasing the need for constant learning, adaptation, and inno- vation by individuals, teams, and entire organizations

### Personal Conclusion

本章首先对Organizational Behavior做了一个简要介绍，以下片段涵盖了Organizational Behavior研究的大致主题:

> individual characteristics such as beliefs, values and personality; individual processes such as perception, motivation, decision making, judgment, commitment and control; group characteristics such as size, composition and structural properties; group processes such as decision making and leadership; organizational processes and practices such as goal setting, appraisal, feedback, rewards, behavioral aspects of task design; and the influence of all of these on such individual, group, and organi- zational outcomes as performance, turnover, absenteeism, and stress.

其次对Leadership和Mangement做了细致的对比分析，其主要不同可见上表分析，简要的总结如下

> Leadership is the process of developing ideas and a vision, living by values that support those ideas and that vision, influencing others to embrace them in their own behaviors, and making hard decisions about human and other resources. Leadership includes the seven foundation competencies developed throughout this book and more. In contrast, management focuses on looking inward, improving the present, tight controls, direct- ing, coordinating, efficiency, and the like. Both leaders and managers must accept three key functions to be effective: authority, responsibility, and accountability.
